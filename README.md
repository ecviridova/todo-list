# todo-list

A todo-list project contains examples of today's affairs (items) which are created while running. Also functionality of managing (add, delete, update) new items was implemented. All the items are keeping in memory and don't require interaction with any database. The app doesn't save any changes committed while running.

To run the app: mvn clean install cargo:run
